# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you can explore some of the projects I’ve worked on, including predictive modeling, time series forecasting, and machine learning. These projects highlight my skills in data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization.

## 🔹 My Data Science Journey
As a passionate Data Scientist, I enjoy exploring and analyzing data to help solve real-world problems. I have experience working with various datasets, applying machine learning algorithms, and creating interactive data visualizations.

Outside of GitHub, I actively contribute to the Data Science community:
- 🌍 I regularly share insights and projects on **Kaggle** and **Medium**.
- 💡 I’m continuously learning and working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.

## 🔹 Featured Projects:
- [Time Series Forecasting with Wavelet and Random Forest vs ARIMA (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/miraterekhova/time-serias-wavlet-rf-vs-arima) - A comparison of Time Series forecasting models using Wavelet transform and Random Forest vs ARIMA.
- [Churn Prediction Analysis](https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction) - A project to predict customer churn.
- [Sales Forecasting using Time Series](https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting) - Predict future sales based on historical data.

## 🔹 Articles:
